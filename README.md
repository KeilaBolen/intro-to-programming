# Practice Makes Perfect

## This is supposed to be an `<h2>Header 2</h2>`

### `<h3>` (you get the picture)

But, what about stuff in these `backticks`?  Those are for surrounding code samples.

This is a backtick: `

A tiny little symbol above your Tab key and to the left of your 1 key and it looks sort of like an apostrophe.  The other way to remember is that it is the ~ tilde without pressing the shift key.

This is a test repository.

This syntax is for anything that uses a .md for the filename can use markdown to generate HTML that is otherwise tedious to type out.  Say goodbye to all those stinking angle brackets.

However, if you want to do something custom, you still need to use the technologies of the web including:

- **HTML (hypertext markup language)**
 - for layout and organization of information
 - think of these as documents with hierarchies
 - `index.html` is the defacto name for the document that gets served up at the root of the website such as what is displayed if you go to humorouslysad.com.  Like a landing page.
- **CSS (cascading style sheets)**
 - for look and feel as well as positioning, arranging, and so on...
 - These typically have names like style.css and are referenced from index.html by a `<link>` tag inside of `<head>`.
- **JavaScript**
 - for making your application "come alive" ;-)

`Coding is fun!`

A `README.md` file is a place where you can describe what your repository is about.

For instance, you can use it to share your code:

```js

 var kickAss = 100 + ' %!';

 ```

 That's some pretty `k1ck455` code, isn't it? ;-)

 Even if you are just wanting to share a simple website with HTML and CSS, you can do that too.  Just add an index.html and style.css file to your repository and create a branch named `gh-pages`.  But wait, we haven't talked about branches yet.  Don't worry, it's not scary, I promise.

 Making a branch with your favorite git tool is easy.  For instance, making a branch with _GitHub for Windows_.
